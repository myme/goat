# Goat

## Goat wherever you wanna goat

Do you have an irrational fear of goats?<br/>
Do you simply enjoy being in their presence of goats?

It's not easy to know where to start looking (or avoid) when it comes to goats.
Recent intelligence, however, seem to indicate that goats do have a tendency to
flock around farms and surrounding farmland.

This little program works by having you search for your current address
(candidates sorted for your convenience according to your current approximate
position, determined by IP). The program then proceeds to find registered lots
around the entered address where the probability of finding goats `P(goat)` is
greater than `0`.

## Usage

```
Usage: goat <address> <...address>
```

Note: All command line arguments are combined into a single address query.

## Example
